# PoachedBugsVR
SKSE plugin providing a variety of bugfixes and tweaks for Skyrim VR.
Particular focus on reproducing fixes found in Scrambled Bugs for SE/AE that are commonly used across the "Simonrim" suite.

## Settings (in SKSE/plugins/PoachedBugsVR.ini)

Fixes (enabled by default, unless otherwise specified):
* improveAllEnchantmentEffects - Causes all effects in an enchantment to benefit from the players enchanting skill and perks, rather than only the costliest one
* perkEntrySpellCasterFix - Makes it so that the perk owner is recognized as the one who cast the spell on the target, rather than the target casting on themself
* powerAttacksStaminaRequirementNPC - Prevent NPCs from power attacking unless they have enough stamina for the full cost of the power attack. Makes frost magic and stamina draining poisons/spells more useful
* powerAttacksStaminaRequirementPlayer - (DOES NOT ACTUALLY WORK CURRENTLY. Will likely need to be implemented within Planck instead. Disabled here by default). Prevent the player from power attacking unless they have enough stamina for the full cost of the power attack
* drawnBowDetection (VR Unique Fix) - In VR, the IsAttacking and GetAttackState conditions and Papyrus functions are broken for the player and will always return false/kNone when drawing a bow, unlike in flat/SE. This patch works around this by monitoring the VR specific bow draw state and overriding the attack state variable for the player actor when an arrow is notched and drawn back. This patch is required for the full functionality of mods such as JaySerpa's "NPCs Take Cover" (specifically the feature where an NPC warning you to back off will recognize you readying a bow shot and charging you before you release it)
* resetHarvestFlags - Corrects an issue where various harvestable plants fail to correctly save the fact they have respawned, causing a save and reload to result in them suddenly being harvested again inexplicably
* weaponCharge - Allows enchanted weapons to be fully restored instead of being capped to the charge level when they were equipped or recharged last
* enchantmentCost - Save the enchantment cost and value for player enchanted gear to fix a bug that causes these values to go crazy on game reload
* actorValuePercentage - makes GetActorValuePercent, GetHealthPercentage, and GetStaminaPercentage conditions and the GetActorValuePercentage Papyrus function correctly account for temporary buffs and debuffs to maximum actor values
* armorWeightModPerkEntry - makes it so that only the specific piece(s) of armor that are actually being worn are rendered weightless by things like the Conditioning/Unhindered perk or Steed Stone, rather than all copies of that same armor type

Tweaks (disabled by default, unless otherwise specified):
* poisonsUseOtherResistances - Poisons effects are resisted by their respective resist actor values, instead of always being resisted by poison resistance
* scrollsGrantExperience - Scrolls will grant experience when used, similar to actually casting their spell. Requires a mod to adjust scrolls to account for this (such as Mysticism)
* stavesGrantExperience - Staves will also grant experience similar to casting the spell they hold. Requires a mod to adjust scrolls to account for this (such as Mysticism)
* staffExperienceIgnoresEnchantmentCost - Stave experience gain is not effected by its enchantment cost. Recommended for use with Mysticism/Simonrim. Does nothing unless also using stavesGrantExperience
* perkEntryMultipleSpellsApplication - Allows multiple perk entry points to all simultaneously apply spells to their relevant targets, rather than only one being allowed. Will cause issues for mods that attempt to work around this limitation on their own.
* accumulateMagnitudeScaling - Makes accumulate magnitude type effects (such as wards) increase in maximum magnitude instead of accumulation rate when having their effectiveness increased by things such as dual casting or perk entry points
* reflectDamageLimitRemoval - (enabled by default) Removes the 100% cap on the reflect damage actor value
* levelledCharacter - Allows "very hard" levelled enemies to spawn in the same enemies as just "hard" level, unlike in the unedited basegame where they *must* be higher level if available even if it breaks the normal encounter zone rules
* difficultyMultipliers.commandedActors - makes summoned, reanimated, and mind controlled allies of the player use the same difficulty modifier for damage received as the player instead of the NPC/enemy modifier
* difficultyMultipliers.teammates - makes followers use the same difficulty modifier for damage received as the player instead of the NPC/enemy modifier
